/// comparing it to the real `prompt_eval_count` Ollama reports each turn. Dense or
/// technical text tokenizes to more tokens than chars/4 predicts, so a document can
/// fill far more of the window than the estimate suggests — the cause of mid-reply
/// truncation. The factor (actual ÷ estimated tokens) is smoothed across turns and
/// clamped so budgeting reflects how a model *actually* tokenizes, turning a static
/// guess into a measurement that improves after the first reply.
///
/// The factor is only ever applied to make budgets **more** conservative (clamped to
/// ≥ 1), so a noisy under-estimate can never trick the planner into overfilling the
/// window. Persisted per model name so it carries across sessions and launches.
